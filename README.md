# Development-of-a-capacitive-insole-for-the-assessment-of-load-distribution

This project was undertaken as a component of the Technologies for Sensors course in the first year of my Masterâ€™s program.

The aim of the project was to develop a prototype of a sensorized insole using  capacitive sensing technology to assess the load distribution on the feet during gait.
For further information about the project look at the powerpoint presentation "final_presentation.ppt" that shows the aim of the project and how we build our prototype. 

This project was a key part of the Technologies for Sensors course in the first year of my Master's studies.

The project's objective was to craft a prototype of a sensorized insole, employing capacitive sensing technology to measure foot load distribution during walking.

Additional details on the project's goals and the construction of our prototype can be found in the "final_presentation.ppt" PowerPoint presentation.
